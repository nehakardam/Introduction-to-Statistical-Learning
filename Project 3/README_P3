# Project Title: Text Classification on 20 Newsgroups Dataset Using Machine Learning

## Description:
–	Worked on the challenging task of text classification using the 20 Newsgroups dataset, a collection of posts from twenty different newsgroups, dating back to 1997.
–	Implemented a machine learning model to predict the category (newsgroup) to which a post belongs based on its text content.
–	Developed two classification options: a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression, utilizing Python programming and machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn.
–	Conducted data preprocessing, including data download, loading, and vocabulary selection using mutual information.
–	Employed mutual information to select a subset of the vocabulary, ranking words by their significance in predicting newsgroup labels.
–	Explored three different input representations for text documents: binary indicators, raw word counts, and log-normalized word counts.
–	Trained models for each input representation and classifier choice, optimizing hyperparameters through validation data.
–	Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics and compared it against a baseline model that predicts the most frequent class.
–	Conducted a thorough evaluation on test data, reporting accuracy, and identifying the top misclassified label pairs.
–	Examined model weights to gain insights into the most influential features for each class and compared these results with mutual information rankings.

## Key Achievements:
–	Successfully implemented and compared two machine learning classifiers for text classification.
–	Utilized advanced techniques such as mutual information for vocabulary selection.
–	Conducted in-depth model evaluation, including accuracy and misclassification analysis.
–	Analyzed model weights to interpret feature importance.
