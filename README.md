# Introduction to Statistical Learning

Welcome to the README file for the projects completed as part of the course "Introduction to Statistical Learning." This repository contains a collection of diverse projects, each addressing unique topics and challenges in the field of statistical learning and machine learning. Below, you will find brief descriptions of each project:

## Project 1: Performance Comparison of K-Nearest-Neighbor and Gaussian Classifiers on Zipcode Data

For this project, we explored and evaluated the performance of two fundamental classifiers: the K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) Classifier and the Gaussian Classifier. Using Python and machine learning libraries, we conducted experiments on the Zipcode dataset, optimizing hyperparameters and conducting rigorous model evaluations.

## Project 2: Predictive Modeling and Regression Analysis for Housing Prices

In this project, we delved into predictive modeling and regression analysis to estimate housing prices. We meticulously handled data preprocessing, including managing missing values, and implemented linear regression models. The incorporation of one-hot encoding for categorical features and the utilization of L1 regularization (Lasso Regression) enhanced the accuracy of our models.

## Project 3: Text Classification on 20 Newsgroups Dataset Using Machine Learning

This project tackled the challenging task of text classification using the 20 Newsgroups dataset. We developed two classification options: a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression, employing data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation techniques. The results showcase the effectiveness of these classifiers in categorizing text posts.

## Project 4: Neural Network and Autoencoder Implementation for Data Classification and Dimensionality Reduction

This project encompassed two distinct components. First, we engaged in neural network warm-up exercises, generating synthetic data and implementing classification models. Second, we explored autoencoders for dimensionality reduction on galaxy images, comparing their performance with Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Project 5: Language Identification in Twitter Data Using Machine Learning

Developed a language identification system for classifying Twitter text into nine Western European languages. Implemented three models: Language-dependent Markov Models, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Preprocessed Twitter text data, created character-level vocabularies, and achieved model accuracy using validation and test data. Demonstrated proficiency in machine learning and deep learning techniques for text classification.

## Project 6: [Academic Support and Engagement Prediction Among Engineering Students](#README_P6.md)

This project involved a comprehensive study on academic support and engagement among engineering students. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, we predicted students' academic support and engagement scales based on survey data. The results provide valuable insights into tailoring educational experiences for student success.

Each project directory contains detailed README files with in-depth explanations, methodologies, results, and analysis. Feel free to explore each project individually for a comprehensive understanding of the topics covered and the skills demonstrated.
