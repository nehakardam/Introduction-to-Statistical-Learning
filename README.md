# Introduction to Statistical Learning
 
Welcome to the repository for the course "Introduction to Statistical Learning." This repository contains projects and assignments related to statistical learning, machine learning, and data analysis tasks. Each project focuses on different aspects of data analysis and modeling, demonstrating skills in Python programming, machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing, and more.

 
In my repository, I have folders named HW1, HW2, HW3, HW4, and HW5. Each folder contains a Jupyter notebook, a PDF file, or a file related to the homework. I also have a project folder with two pdf files: one for the project proposal and one for the main project file. It also includes some jupyter notebooks of the programs I created while working on my project.
      Project 1: Project Title: Performance Comparison of K-Nearest-Neighbor and Gaussian Classifiers on Zipcode Data
      Project 2: Predictive Modeling and Regression Analysis for Housing Prices
      Project 3: Text Classification on 20 Newsgroups Dataset Using Machine Learning
      Project 4: Neural Network and Autoencoder Implementation for Data Classification and Dimensionality Reduction
      Project 5: Predicting Student Engagement Using Machine Learning Techniques

For detailed project descriptions and implementation details, please refer to the individual project directories.
