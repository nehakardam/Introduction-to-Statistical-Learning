In my repository, I have folders named HW1, HW2, HW3, HW4, and HW5. Each folder contains a Jupyter notebook, a PDF file, or a file related to the homework. I also have a project folder with two pdf files: one for the project proposal and one for the main project file. It also includes some jupyter notebooks of the programs I created while working on my project.
