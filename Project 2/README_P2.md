# Project Title: Predictive Modeling and Regression Analysis for Housing Prices

## Project Description:
•	Loaded and analyzed housing data from the AmesHousing.txt file, consisting of 2931 rows and various numerical and categorical features.
•	Performed data preprocessing, handling missing values in numerical and categorical features.
•	Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets using the "Order" column.
•	Conducted one-variable least squares linear regression to predict sale prices based on the "Gr Liv Area" feature.
•	Expanded the model by incorporating one-hot encoding for categorical features and combined them with numerical features.
•	Evaluated model performance using root mean squared error (RMSE) on the validation set.

## Key Achievements:
•	Successfully preprocessed and split the dataset into appropriate subsets.
•	Implemented and evaluated linear regression models, including one-variable and multivariable models.
•	Demonstrated the use of one-hot encoding for categorical features.
•	Utilized L1 regularization (Lasso Regression) to improve model performance.
•	Employed cross-validation to select the optimal regularization parameter (alpha).

## Skills Demonstrated:
•	Data Preprocessing
•	Linear Regression
•	Model Evaluation
•	Feature Engineering (One-Hot Encoding)
•	L1 Regularization (Lasso Regression)
•	Cross-Validation
•	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## Tools and Technologies:
- Tools: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Excel
- Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, XlsxWriter
- Data Sources: Ames Housing dataset

## Achievements and Outcomes:
- Achieved a competitive RMSE score on the test data, demonstrating the effectiveness of the predictive model.
- Effectively communicated complex concepts, such as regularization and overfitting, in the project report.
