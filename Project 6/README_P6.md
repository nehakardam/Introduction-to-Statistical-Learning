# Predicting Students Engagement Using Machine Learning Techniques

## Project Description

This study involves the analysis of academic support and course-level engagement among students in both remote and in-person settings. Over 1,000 surveys were collected, and Likert scale survey data was used for analysis. The participants included students from 19 courses at the junior and sophomore levels in electrical and mechanical engineering at a large public research institution. 

Students reported their present and preferred levels of academic support and engagement within both in-person and remote learning settings. The primary objective of this project was to predict students' academic support and engagement scales using machine learning algorithms and models.

## Methodology

Machine learning algorithms and models were employed to predict the academic support and engagement scales of students. The primary evaluation criteria used was Mean Squared Error (MSE). The results of this study revealed that out of the various approaches and methods employed, only three machine learning methods performed optimally in predicting the mean square error.

## Key Findings

The study provides valuable insights into how student demographics can predict instructional and engagement support. This information is of significant benefit to educators and educational institutions, enabling them to create plans and allocate resources to provide students with the best learning environment.
